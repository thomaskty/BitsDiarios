    "- The CLT provides a theoretical foundation for using the normal distribution in hypothesis tests, even when the distribution of the population is unknown or not necessarily normal.\n",
    "- The CLT states that, under certain conditions, the distribution of the sum or average of a large enough number of independent, identically distributed random variables will be approximately normal, regardless of the original distribution of the variables. This is crucial for hypothesis testing, as it allows us to make inferences about the population based on the normal distribution."
